# Development Installation

When you want to use docutools within your project, in order to generate documentation for it:

- Add `docutools = "^<version>"` as a **development dependency**, e.g. within a
  :srcref:fn=pyproject.toml file.
- Some :srcref:fn=environ,t=environment variables are required for specific features
- Adapt your `mkdocs.yml` file for the plugins you want to use. We do not interfere with any custom
  css or js.
