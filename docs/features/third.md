# Plugins

`docutools` will install 3rd party plugins for mkdocs, ready for use right away.

See :srcref:pyproject.toml, for the packages we depend on.


!!! note "Size"
    Those plugins increase the initial download time of documentation, if enabled in `mkdocs.yml`.
    Users which stay on your documentation page, having the libs cached at subsequent visits.


## Which

- We have pretty much all of these:  
https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/abbreviations/.

- And a few of these:  
https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/superfences/

- Plus some standard markdown extensions, e.g. tables.

- And also our own ones, described in this documentation.

See the :srcref:mkdocs.yml file to get an overview.

Below a few important extensions - but check the above pages for details on usage:
 
## Admonitions

!!! hint "A hint"
    this is an admonition.


```
!!! hint "A hint"
    this is an admonition.
```


## Inline Admonitions

Admonitions can also be rendered as inline blocks (i.e. for sidebars), placing
them to the right using the `inline` + `end` modifiers, or to the left using
only the `inline` modifier:

=== ":octicons-arrow-right-16: inline end"

    !!! info inline end

        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et
        euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo
        purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa.

    The content block we put the admon next to (can be anything, incl. an admonition)
    
    Use `inline end` to align to the right (left for rtl languages).

=== ":octicons-arrow-left-16: inline"

    !!! info inline

        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et
        euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo
        purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa.

    The content block we put the admon next to


    Use `inline` to align to the left (right for rtl languages).

__Important__: admonitions that use the `inline` modifiers _must_ be declared
prior to the content block you want to place them beside. If there's
insufficient space to render the admonition next to the block, the admonition
will stretch to the full width of the viewport, e.g. on mobile viewports.

  [Inline support]: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/releases/tag/7.0.0

## Snippets

Allow to embed complex other content into your markdown.

In your mkdocs.yml you can then supply custom base paths, containing e.g. your own abbreviations, libraries or whatever you require on certain pages.


This is [a demo][demo]. The actual link is provided by an import of a text file (e.g. here :srcref:docs/links.txt ), loaded via a snippet.


```
This is [a demo][demo]. 

And elsewhere, e.g. at the bottom embed the links:

--8<--  
links.txt
--8<--  
```

Note that you can provide, in :srcref:mkdocs.yml , custom locations for such snippets, i.e. within project.

--8<--
links.txt
--8<--

## Md in HTML

<!-- drives the editor syn highlighter crazy -> at the end -->

Works even within markdown, i.e. within tabs:

=== "Source"

    <div markdown="block" style="background-color: purple">

    A *Markdown* paragraph within html setting the background color to purple.

    * A list item.
    * A second list item.

    ```python
    # and some fenced code within the html
    foo = "bar"
    ```

    </div>

=== "Source"
    ```

        <div markdown="block" style="background-color: purple">

        A *Markdown* paragraph within html setting the background color to purple.

        * A list item.
        * A second list item.

        ```python
        # and some fenced code within the html
