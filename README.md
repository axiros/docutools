## [Documentation](https://axgkl.github.io/docutools/) building tools

Notes:

- "Work in Progress" The termcast feature is heavily W.I.P!
- Many feats not yet documented

This library is meant to be used as a development dependency for projects which want [mkdocs/material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) based documentation,
pulling in all the necessary dependencies plus adding a few strong features as well, which were to hard / did not make sense to realize as mkdocs plugins.
